# rces-final-project
My final project repository for RCES.

Visualization of modeled ash dispersal outputs with existing data from an Aleutian eruption modeled using PF3D/FALL3D. For eventual application with the Okmok II CFE (43 BCE), a large climate-cooling eruption with evidence of widespread tephra dispersal.
